# MCT Visual Feddback for OSC Messages (Physical Computing and Audio Programming)

This repository contains a Unity project that uses [UnityOSC] (https://thomasfredericks.github.io/UnityOSC/) library to map visuals and sonic events between several systems. It was used in the following courses:

## MCT4000: Module "Physical Computing"

In this case the scenes **DesktopApp.unity** and **MobileApp.unity** where used for communicating a mobile phone and a desktop for a musical performance. It can be found [here](https://mct-master.github.io/physical-computing/2020/10/16/pedropl-pyco-unexpected-spaceship.html).

## MCT4048: Audio Programming

In this course the scene **SuperLooperVisuals.unity** was used to provide visuals through OSC for a groupal project related with a looper with effects implemented in CSound (Tapeloop DT-20). Details can be found [here](https://mct-master.github.io/audio/programming/2021/02/19/henrikhs-DT20.html).
